# The Librenet Foundation

Social networking is a human right. A cornerstone of our species is our
relentless need to communicate and socialize. The Internet has proved
to be a boon for this communication: many of those otherwise without
voice can be heard online.

Users tend to think of sites like Facebook and Twitter as "public
squares," or noisy caf√©s, where private people have private
conversations within their own personal networks of human connection.

The reality, however, is much different: users of such sites are
products bought and sold by information brokers. Such sites are
designed to be completely addictive, always-on, and monopolistic,
replacing functionality that simpler, older tools have provided for decades.

The startup fantasies emanating outward from Silicon Valley are
poison. They are predicated on selfishness, vanity, and a commitment
to profit above all else. One of the many lies startup culture tells
us is that to sustain a popular and useful web service a route to
profit is necessary. In other words, the profit-driven evil of
services like Facebook is considered a necessary and Faustian
trade-off for its existence.

The Librenet Foundation proposes an alternate way, one already forged
by the Wikimedia Foundation. A way based on the ideals of
not-for-profit organization and strong copyleft. We hope
that Librenet is the first of many projects built to replace the
corrupted and privacy-destroying services we've accepted for years out
of a broken and fundamentally evil startup culture.

## Principles

* **If its existence is worthwhile, it will be supported**. A non-profit lives on
  donations, a conscious commitment on behalf of a user that the
  provided service is worthwhile and important.

* **Utility for users is the ultimate priority**. The SaaS and
  proprietary software industry is replete with examples of software
  that [arbitrarily limits its own utility in order to segment its
  market][segment-market] and maximize the profit that might be
  extracted from it. Librenet Foundation software will _never_ include
  arbitrary or artificial limitations.

* **Strict adherence to Strong Copyleft and Free Software Licensing**.
  The Librenet Foundation publishes all code under the GPLv3.

* **Holistic design** The Librenet Foundation does not prioritize
  real-time, addictive information overload. TODO less strong
  language; key here is lack of priortization, not assertion of evil

* **Transparent Financing** The Librenet Foundation provides accurate
  and thorough expenditure breakdowns for all services rendered such
  that funders can make informed decisions.

* **Open development, open deployment** As much as possible, the active
  development and deployment of Librenet Foundation software will be
  visible to anyone.

* **Privacy Protection** Just because the Librenet Foundation runs
  hosted services, we stake no claim on any data you produce and store
  with us. User data is, as much as possible, encrypted from our eyes
  and decrypted with client-side technology.

* **Encouraged Anonymity** The Internet was founded on notions of
  Pseudonyms and Anonymity. These ideals are undermined by for-profit,
  advertising-supported services. The Librenet Foundation supports and
  upholds them. Librenet Foundation software and services will _never_
  employ a "[real name policy][]."

* **Programmability** Projects by the Librenet Foundation will always
  support a robust and easy-to-use API.

## Roadmap

Right now, Librenet is little more than a manifesto. At a high level,
our plan is:

 0. Foundational thoughts and ideas
 1. An RFC-style standards document describing a Facebook-style social
    networking service
 2. A reference implementation of that standard, sans client-side
    encrypting of data, coded and hosted
 3. Possible kickstarter or other fundraising drive
 4. Client-side encryption for existing network
 5. An RFC-style standards document describing a Twitter-style social
    status sharing service
 6. An implementation thereof that reuses the encryption schemes
    developed for the initial service.


NOTES
-----

Manifesto is semi-internal; it's not secret, but isn't first-line
public PR. Strong language is more for contributors / collaborators /
funders to understand mission.

Why just not use / contibute to Diaspora? It's no longer a POS
for-profit startup awful thing, it's a seemingly well-working
decentralized network backed by a nonprofit.
